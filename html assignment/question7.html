    <h1>How To Value Your Self</h1>
    <p>We all have that loud inner voice that is not always kind. It interjects when we have ideas and projects at hand,
         and it often persuades us from taking that leap of faith or believing in ourselves.
         When left unchecked, the inner critic can have devastating effects on our self-esteem</p>
         <p>It is not always easy to show up to life. We do not always stop to examine just how much effort we put forth in everyday living.
             One way to value yourself more is to be grateful for everything you do.</p>
             <p>Forgiveness is the free remedy that can alleviate so much of our suffering when we hold onto bitterness.
                 It is worthy of implementing it into our everyday life.</p>
