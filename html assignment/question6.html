    <h1>What is so great about animes??</h1>
    <p>There are a number of reasons why I choose to watch animes all day,
        all week, all month and all year. The animations are awesome although not all but at least 
        most of them. They teach value of friendship, staying strong and being true to one's commitment.
    </p>
    <p>Just like movies, animes lovers or newbies can choose an anime according to their mood, interest and atmosphere.
        there are a variety of animess to choose from. They include cooking animes, demons related animes, love/romance related animes,
        drama animes, sci-fi related animes, highschool related animes, horror, fantansy, detective, thrill and even sport animes are not excluded...
